# standalone-roblox-stream-sniper
it's a stream sniper, does the same thing like all the others, join someone's game
but this one is launching roblox directly, that's it, nothing else
i just thought it would be cool to make something like this

so how to use this:
  1. install rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  2. download this
  3. run build.cmd
  4. profit
  
 yeah also have common sense please (like dont re-release, claim its yours, sell it, you get my point, just dont)
